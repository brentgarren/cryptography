One of the simplest form of cryptography is the caeser cipher. Wherein you shift every letter either further or backwards an "X" amount of spaces.

The caeser cipher is considered a substition cipher as each letter is substitued with another letter.

Transpositional Cipher which mixes the order of the letters while still substituting each letter for another "X" spaces away
