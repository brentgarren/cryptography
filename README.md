# cryptography
Terminology
Symmetric encryption, such as AES<br>
Asymmetric encryption, such as RSA<br>
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange<br>
Hashing<br>
PKI - an arrangement that binds public keys with respective identities of entities (like people and organizations).<br>
Cryptographic Algorithm or Cipher - This algorithm defines the encryption and decryption processes.<br>
Key - The cryptographic algorithm needs a key to convert the plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.
plaintext - is the original message that we want to encrypt<br>
ciphertext - is the message in its encrypted form<br>



One of the simplest form of cryptography is the caeser cipher. Wherein you shift every letter either further or backwards an "X" amount of spaces.

The caeser cipher is considered a substition cipher as each letter is substitued with another letter.

--------------

Transpositional Cipher which mixes the order of the letters while still substituting each letter for another "X" spaces away To figure out the order of letters we would need a key for instance 12345 which would write the alphabet vertically and then using a key 5 substition to find the message.
